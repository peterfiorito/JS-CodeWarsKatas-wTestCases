# JS-CodeWarsKatas-wTestCases #

As a tracking experiment, I am keeping a copy of my old kata solutions.
Seeing some of them, specially the really old ones, it's kind of eye soaring.. but they are also a reminder of how you are at constant evolution in your coding skills.

It is VERY probable, that once I get all this material organized in the repo, I will start refactoring A LOT of these katas.
I think this repo will be a great tool as I start refactoring old code and will help me keep track of the evolution and changes in my coding ideas and style.

This repo will keep open/public, for people looking for test cases or just alternative solutions to the codeWars katas, as I assume that will be the only people interested in this kind of content.

If you need any coding help or just want to talk, shoot me a message here or in any of my social media, I am always happy to talk to likeminded individuals.

Thank you for visiting and have a great day!
